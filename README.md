# Javalupe Studios Logo

This repo contains the logo of Javalupe Studios.

![javalupe-logo](logo/javalupe-logo.png)

## Explanation

Our name is a mishmash of "Java" (the programming language that was used in our first game), "Luiza" and "Pedro" (the team that worked on our first game). Since it sounds a lot like "Guadalupe", our logo was made to look like a typical park logo and features *El Capitan*, the most famous landmark of the Guadalupe Mountains National Park. The boar (*javali*, in Portuguese) at the bottom is, again, a nod to the Java programming language.
